                <p>Din Djarin, better known as the Mandalorian, is a bounty hunter operating in a galaxy far, far away several years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the (seeming) death of Emperor Palpatine. As a child, his family was killed in an attack on his village by battle droids. However, Din was saved by a group of Mandalorians, a tribe of warriors who religiously deck themselves out in unique armor and pride themselves on their combat skills. Taken in as a "foundling," Din rose through the ranks of the Mandalorians and took up bounty hunting, gaining a legendary reputation in the Bounty Hunters' Guild. One mission would bring him to the planet Arvala-7, where he would discover his mark was actually a 50 year old baby of the same species as famed Jedi master Yoda named Grogu. Refusing to kill the infant, Din decided to take it with him, an action that wouldn't only spur the attention of other bounty hunters, but the Imperial remnants that wanted the baby in the first place too.</p>

                                diverse gadgets, such as tech built into its helmet visor which grants infrared vision.
                                Heavy blaster pistol: A gun that shoots focused high-penetration plasma bolts. Mando is particularly good with it both in accuracy and on quickdraws.</p>
