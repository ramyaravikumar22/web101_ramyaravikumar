    <p>A fast runner with extra-ordinary abilities which gt acquired when struck by a lightning. My favorite hobby is to help and protect the world from negative psychotic waves. I also live an ordinary life as a Chief officer at CCPD under forensics and love what I do. During my free time, I study science and build teleporting machines for time travel and the old me, my wife and my young kids. Iâ€™m also called with a name Flash. &#9889;</p>
